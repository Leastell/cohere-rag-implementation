# RAG implementation - Exercise

This project implements a small Retrival-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using **Cosine Similarity** and **Cohere LLMs**. I built it on top of a **FastAPI** backend.

I wrote this as a research task to prepare for a job interview The goal was primarily to demonstrate professional code structure and testing practices while brushing up on LLMs.

---

## 📌 Overview

This service allows users to submit natural-language questions to the `/query` endpoint via POST request. The service will respond with an LLM-generated natural-language response that cites real documents.

At startup, the application generates embeddings for the files in the `documents/` directory using a [Cohere Embedding model](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/embeddings). These embeddings are stored in an `EmbeddingIndex` for later reference as requests are made.

For each incoming query, the user's prompt is embedded using the `LlmClient`. Then, using [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), the query embeddings are compared to the cached document embeddings via the `RagService`. The top `k` most-similar documents are used to inform a chat response, which is generated using the [Cohere chat endpoint](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/chat).

### Example

User prompt:

```
{
    "query": "Can I return my purchase?"
}
```

Service response[^1]:

```
{
    "answer": "Yes, you can return your purchase within 30 days as long as the item is in its original condition [1]. To initiate a return, contact customer support with your order number [1]. Note that return shipping costs may apply depending on the reason for the return [1].",
    "documents": [
        {
            "rank": 1,
            "score": 0.5211235585017844,
            "id": "returns.txt",
            "text": "Items can be returned within 30 days as long as they are in their original condition. \nTo start a return, contact customer support with your order number. \nReturn shipping costs may apply depending on the reason for return. \nExchanges are available for items of equal value."
        }
    ]
}
```

[^1]: topK is limited to 1 for demonstration purposes.

## Architecture

High-level response generation flow:

```
Query
    ↓
LlmClient embeds query using Cohere
    ↓
RagService determines cosine similarity against EmbeddingIndex
    ↓
Select Top-K documents
    ↓
Build prompt with numbered citations
    ↓
LlmClient generates answer using Cohere
    ↓
Return JSON response with answer + citations + context docs
```

## Running Locally

### 1. Set up `.venv` and install dependencies.

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create .env

Create a `.env` file with the following variable:

```
COHERE_API_KEY=[Your API key]
```

You can optionally override the default embedding and chat models by setting the following variables:

```
    EMBED_MODEL=[Chosen Cohere embedding model]
    CHAT_MODEL=[Chosen Cohere chat model]
```

### 3. Start the server

Run this command in your (venv-activated) terminal to start the FastAPI server

```
fastapi dev app/main.py
```

Document embeddings are generated automatically on startup.

## Testing

Tests use `pytest` and `monkeypatch` to mock Cohere calls.
Run tests by executing the `pytest` command in your terminal.
